# React Portfolio

For this challenge, we will utilize what we have learned in `Module 13: React` at the edX BootCamp for Frontend Web Development to develop the initial scaffolding of our portfolio sites.

## Requirements

### Design

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Base Requirements

* Technologies that must be used:
  * [ ] React
  * [ ] Navigation with `React Router`, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
* Your portfolio **must contain** the following information:
  * [ ] Your name
  * [ ] Links to your:
    * [ ] GitHub Profile
    * [ ] LinkedIn Page
    * [ ] Email Address
    * [ ] Phone Number - (optional)
    * [ ] PDF version of your resume
      * Your resume **must** contain up-to-date projects and professional experience
    * [ ] A list of projects (Challenges or Projects). For each project, make sure you have the following:
      * [ ] Project title
      * [ ] Link to the deployed version
      * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
      * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

### Required Components

* At a minium, your portfolio must render these 6 components:
  1. [ ] App

  * [ ] Must render dynamically 6 instances of the Project component
    * [ ] Be sure to store your project data in a JSON file and import it into your project
* [ ] Project:
   * [ ] Must be a reusable component that ingests JSON data as a props and renders a single instance for each project.
   * [ ] Must utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
   * [ ] Must render the following info:
     * [ ] Project title
     * [ ] Link to the deployed version
